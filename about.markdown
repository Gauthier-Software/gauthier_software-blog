My name is Maxime Gauthier and I go by the alias biximilien online.

I am a ruby developer with a background in research and experimental development.
My work is focused on open source technologies to create innovative solutions
for small and medium sized businesses.

Gauthier Software is my personal company, and has been in business since 2014.
My main services offering is my technical expertise related to research and
experimental development, and systems design. You can have a look at my
[company website][gauthier.software] for a full list of services.

I have decided to start this blog as an incentive for myself to give back to the
community. Having worked in the private sector with open source technologies, I
have found that I did not contribute most of my work back to the open source
community. Going forward, I have decided to contribute as much as possible.

On this blog, I intend to post about my current interests such as technology,
experimental development, Ruby development and system design. I also intend to
document challenges I have faced and the solutions I have implemented.

Hopefully, this might be useful to others.
